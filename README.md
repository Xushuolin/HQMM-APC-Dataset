Creating high-quality animations for cartoon portraits requires extensive datasets that capture the nuances of multimodal interactions, including visual, auditory, and textual information. Current datasets often lack the richness and diversity needed to train advanced models for this purpose. To address this gap, we present HQMM-CPA, a high-quality multimodal dataset specifically designed for cartoon portrait animation. HQMM-CPA comprises over 3,000 annotated cartoon portraits, each accompanied by synchronized audio and face 68 keypoints annotation. Our dataset includes diverse expressions, poses, and speaking styles, captured under various conditions, to facilitate the development of robust and versatile animation models. We detail the dataset collection, annotation process, and its multimodal features. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HQMM-CPA by training state-of-the-art models and showcasing significant improvements in animation quality and realism. This dataset opens new avenues for research in cartoon animation and multimodal learning, providing a valuable resource for the community.
